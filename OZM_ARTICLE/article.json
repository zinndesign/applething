Kryger, M.D., a physician and professor of medicine at the Yale School of Medicine. And there are all sorts of problems with pills. Over time, your body can adapt to the medication so that you'll need a higher dosage. Plus, there's the risk of \"rebound insomnia\"\u2014the insomnia returns the second you stop taking the pills. The safest solution is to get the help you need to address the anxiety that's keeping you awake, but if you must reach for a pill, don't grab an OTC sleep aid. Popping one at 3 or 4 A.M. doesn't allow enough time for it to wear off before you wake up in the morning. Instead, talk to your doctor about Rx options with a very short half-life so that if you take a pill, it's gone from your system in three or four hours.",

That's because, back in our cavemen days, there was survival value in assuming things would end badly\u2014it allowed us to be prepared in case we needed to flee for our lives.\n2. The brain triggers a little freak-out. The primitive part of the brain\u2014the amygdala\u2014thinks your idle ruminations are urgent matters that need to be dealt with right away. In a process called cognitive fusion, it treats worried thoughts as if they're real emergencies.\n3. The body becomes very alert. Your amygdala has just initiated a fight-or-flight response to get you ready to take on whatever's coming. Your brain releases adrenaline and cortisol, and your body reacts: Your heart rate and blood pressure rise, and your muscles may even start to tighten.\n4. You're wide awake on the worry treadmill. People tend to catastrophize in the middle of the night\u2014in other words, your brain makes a big deal out of everything. The larger our problems seem, the more alert the body becomes (again, that's adrenaline at work) to try to solve those problems.",
