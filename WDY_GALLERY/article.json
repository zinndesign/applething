We don't, but trolls have been coming at her saying \"sticking your pregnant abdomen out like that is disgusting.\" So Fehlinger took to [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/181473545215720/photos/a.272484609447946.85682.181473545215720/1120572401305825/?type=1) to acknowledge her haters and declare her pregnancy pride.\n\n\"Frankly, I don't care how 'terrible' or 'inappropriate' anyone thinks I look. I will gladly gain 50 pounds & suffer sleepless, uncomfortable nights if it means upping my chances to deliver 2 healthy baby girls. Now it's about more than aesthetics. I want these babies to have the best start possible. And that hopefully means my belly that 'looks like it's about to explode!' will continue to grow the next few weeks.\"\n\nBut she didn't stop there. The TV personality took this opportunity to applaud all mothers and soon-to-be moms for their courage and strength to endure labor.\n\n\"I say let's raise a Shirley Temple to swollen feet, stretch marks, nausea, all the extra pounds and the dark circles! They're [badges of motherhood](http://www.womansday.com/relationships/family-friends/a51416/husband-gives-pregnancy-announcement-before-wife-even-knows-shes-pregnant/). And for those of you who think that's 'disgusting', remember a woman went through the very same thing to bring YOU into the world.\"",

Probably 99.5 percent of things I really do read.

But Lindsey wanted to make sure that others aren't discouraged from taking the step toward becoming healthier.\n\n\"Let me make one thing very clear, I am not ashamed of my body. It has never stopped me from doing anything I want. My fat body has done things that you, hanging out of the window of your babe-magnet white van could only ever dream of. My fat body has been swimming in crystal clear Thai seas that you have probably only ever seen on TV. It has lived in countries you wouldn't dream of visiting and been a part of cultures you are too small minded to appreciate. My fat legs have carried me up mountains on more than one occasion. My fat brain speaks languages you probably don't see the point of learning, which is why you spend your time hanging out of van windows since you have nothing better to occupy it with.\"\n\nRead the [rest of the amazing post here](https://www.facebook.com/lindsey.swift1/posts/10156043200800157). Keep doing you, Lindsey.",
